# Chess++

> This will be our redesigned chess game that will include additional pieces, goals, unlocks, as well as extended boards. We will begin by making the standard game of chess at first. Eventually, our team, Guillermo Gomez, Roy Grady, Kody Davis, Felipe Rodriguez, and Kieran Hsieh, will add more pieces, spaces, goals, and achievements in-game. Our goal is to test our own personal skills by creating something similar yet different. This project will be for chess enthusiasts who want some variety in their gameplay. We hope to create an interesting and dynamic chess game that will be user friendly, challenging, fun, and unique.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development       
* -

To-do list:
* Fundamental movement/position mechanics of the chess engine
           This lays the foundations of the game so that the base rules of chess are established.
           This feature is vital for any playability and necessary for most future features.
           It corresponds with the story on offline playability.
           
* Implementing classic chess pieces
           Chess pieces are another necessary component of chess playability.
           This feature assigns valid movement options to each chess piece.
           This feature is a prerequisite for the user stories on new and customizable chess pieces.
           
* Menus
           Menus allow users to navigate settings, modes, and other options.
           A successful implementation will be user friendly and visually appealing.
           This corresponds with the user story on intuitive visual interfaces.
           
* Player info
           This feature stores player data such as username, match history, rank, etc...
           It will be used by frequent users and features that rely on metadata.
           This feature corresponds to the user stories on competitive ranking systems.
           
* Board graphics and chess piece sprites
           Basic graphic designs for each essential component of chess.
           The first step in creating an interactive graphic interface for players.
           This also corresponds to the user story on visual interfaces.
